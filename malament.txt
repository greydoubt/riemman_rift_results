anyways
that is why we call it SET OF TEETH THEORY AH AH AH *flies away*

If you balance Gamma and Zeta you see:
One imaginary shark can, with only 1 set of 6 teeth, can induce "the big number"

or, G(1-/12) = K(inf), and then you have a forced torsion group

So you see, 6 teeth are enough

When I was in jail they made me work in a dental school in RusFed. That's why I know so much about Set of Teeth theory.

And that's why it's Set of Teeth theory -- and to take a Power Set is to Witness Set Cover the Lettuce.

It's really funny!

Anyways, I have a theory that the Riemann hypothesis is just a set of fangs biting into something. It makes sense if you look at it. It also models supergravity in a young universe.

I realised that trees, the actual trees, grow according the R-Gamma function, as trees alternate generations in nature and trees cannot be directly copied, only changed into a field

The Zeta function is then the Fangular Momentum if the rest of the universe could *bite* that tree

Or perhaps that is Osiris himself. Mathematics is just, to me at least, how to balance the scales of ma'at when blood is on the line.

Now you know!

This one, however, is my favourite picture. We went through Ancient Egypt (see Battle of the Delta) and the spider came back with a portrait of a pharaoh on her thorax

And that's the phenomenology

You asked me:
How did you do that?

These are the mechanics:
1) Because a 2-spin *always* introduces torsion, i just walked to "yesterday" and flew my fighter jet to irvine, went to the building we were at, took the entire class as a 1/4 tilt acausal hologram, and then one day you asked the room to choose one of two physical laws
thus leaving the entire submanifold open as a kind of one-way trip that has two exits

it's basically open now full time -- there is an exotic foam that just floods the earth as it spins in reverse, then i sail the boat there, and then release a shark with a bunch of books and have that shark attack someone and make it look as if the random person was "almost done" with some groundbreaking work

That shark eventually learned how to write and wrote Die Hard

I also verified that singularities evapourate:
Get as many small hourglasses as you can and just keep turning them
If two grains of sand clog the passage, that's a polymorphic change to the crust around singularities
It's really elegant

David,

I walked into a singularity and turned around. I needed to take your class to understand and verify what happened.

It's really elegant.

Movies do not capture it well, but, time dilations, does in fact, resemble "Tie Dye" because of angular momentum

During this, you can consider the local spacetime a gel-like substrate, and this will follow negative shadows from the imaginary part of the sine wave equation

As such, and you would expect, you walk forward and it curves in and then when you turn around to leave the nonlocality breaks because another dimension of spin occurs

This, a graviton can cancel out another graviton

Think of it as grabbing a drum cymbal

Anyways,

No hard feelings either way
